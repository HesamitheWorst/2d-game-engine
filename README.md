This is a 2d game engine which is used to make a clone of the classic Super Mario, it was made from a tutorial from the youtube channel freecodecamp.org which I will put the link below.
it is not my own project and im only following the tutorial , and i did it just to have a better grasp on things like object oriented programming , low level programming in java , graphics designs , input handlings and loops in game , once i get comfortable I will add more features to the project, for now its just a side gig for when im bored :
