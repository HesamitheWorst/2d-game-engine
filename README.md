# Java 2D Game Engine (Tutorial-based)

This is a 2D game engine I'm building by following a tutorial from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://youtu.be/025QFeZfeyM?si=kt0sh-chDz0Qf6X5).  
The goal of the engine is to create a clone of the classic Super Mario Bros game.

⚠️ This is **not** my original project — I'm following the tutorial step-by-step to better understand:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java  
- Low-level graphics and rendering  
- Input handling  
- Game loops and state management  

Right now, it’s just a learning side project I work on when I’m bored.  
Once I get more comfortable, I plan to experiment by adding new features and making it my own.
